# Monty Interpreter
Welcome to the Monty Bytecode Interpreter. This interpreter was built in the C language and is compliant with ISO90, ISO99, & ISO11. It reads Monty bytecode files of any extension (preferably .m although it doesn't matter), and interprets the opcodes contained.
Our interpreter can be run as either a stack (LIFO) or queue (FIFO).
